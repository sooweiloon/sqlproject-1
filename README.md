# SQL Project: Sales System

## Introduction

This SQL project focuses on developing a comprehensive sales system for HIT SDN BHD (HIT), a company that offers two distinct products to hotels and end-users: Sharifah Ready to Eat and Biodegradable Packaging Items. The existing process of documenting buying and selling activities using Word and Excel has proven to be inefficient for HIT. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create a database system that can effectively monitor customer data, product inventory, purchases, and vendor information.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the HIT Sales System project are as follows:

1. **Customer Management**: Develop a system to store and manage essential customer information, such as name, phone number, address, and email. Customers can be individuals, businesses, or organizations.

2. **Product Management**: Create a database structure to store and manage details about the two products offered by HIT - Sharifah Ready to Eat and Biodegradable Packaging Items. Each product has its own unique set of attributes.

3. **Order Management**: Implement functionalities to handle customer orders, including options for delivery through services like Grabs or Lalamove, or HIT's own delivery crew. Customers may place orders via WhatsApp or e-commerce platforms like Shopee or Lazada. The cost of delivery is the customer's responsibility.

4. **Vendor Management**: Establish a system to manage the procurement of biodegradable packaging materials from multiple suppliers. However, Sharifah Ready to Eat products can only be purchased from Sharifah Food Sdn Bhd. Vendor payments are currently processed through bank transfers.

5. **Quotation and Invoice Generation**: Incorporate features to generate quotations for specific customers and store them in the database. Additionally, each sale should be invoiced, and payments should be made to HIT Company accounts. Examples of a quotation and invoice can be found in Figures 3 and 4.

6. **Commission Calculation**: Calculate commissions for the marketing team based on the product types. The marketing personnel should receive a 3% commission for Bio Packaging sales and a 10% commission for Sharifah Food sales.
