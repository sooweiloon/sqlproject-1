product details can be refer to Figure 1 and Figure 2. Please keep in mind that each of these 
products has a unique set of qualities (attributes).

grabs or lalamove, or the HIT delivery crew can deliver the items to the consumer. The expense of 
delivery was the client's responsibility. HIT can get the order through Whatsapp or an e-commerce 
site like Shopee or Lazada.  

HIT purchases the biodegradable packaging materials from many suppliers. But Sharifah
